# Experience  

## Honeywell Voice Solutions  
#### Software Engineer Intern  
At Honeywell Voice Solutions, I worked in software quality assurance test
automation. Here, I was exposed to a technology that I did not know existed,
browser action automation. Browser automation was done using the industry
standard Selenium API.  

I automated testing of two of their web applications that go with their
main hardware product. Automation I implemented includes, basic tasks that
a typical user would do, verification of the correct creation of entities
on the web application and web scrapping via BeautifulSoup.  

This experience was enriching as I was exposed to a technology I was unaware
of and experienced the effort that goes into ensuring quality of a software
based product. One of the biggest challenges I faced in test automation was
being able traverse complexities of the web applications that made automation
not as straight forward. For example, it is possible to disconnect or timeout
as some actions on the web app are slow, so that must be taken into account
to avoid a false failure.  

Overall, the biggest challenge I faced overcoming the mentality that failure
is bad. As a developer it is disappointing seeing a program fail, but in the
context of quality assurance, it is necessary to catch failures and improve.
Because automation is done programmatically, it is possible that a failure is
a result of something I developed rather than the application I am testing;
learning to distinguish between such errors is a very important skill.
