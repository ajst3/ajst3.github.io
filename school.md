## Computer Science  

#### Cloud Computing and Parallel Computing  
During my coursework, I took advantage of electives that enhanced my knowledge
of modern computing techniques. I was able to take a course in cloud computing
that exposed me to many programming paradigms such as map reduce and secondary
sorting. Additionally, I was exposed to existing cloud software such as
Google Cloud Platform and AWS. Tools and frameworks commonly used like Docker
and Docker-Compose were discussed thoroughly as well.
